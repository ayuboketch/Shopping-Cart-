## Introduction 🌟

The E-commerce Website project aims to create a robust and user-friendly online shopping experience. By leveraging the power of ReactJS, React Router, and Material UI, I've developed a comprehensive e-commerce solution that includes a home page, product listing, individual product details, and more.

## Features 🚀

- **Responsive and Modern Design**: The website is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.
- **Intuitive Navigation**: React Router enables smooth navigation between pages, allowing users to effortlessly explore products, view details, and manage their shopping cart.
- **Product Catalog**: The website displays a comprehensive list of products, featuring images, descriptions, ratings, and pricing information.
- **Product Details**: Users can access detailed information about a specific product, including its full description, reviews, and the ability to add it to the cart or wishlist.
- **Shopping Cart and Wishlist**: Users can add products to their cart and wishlist, providing a convenient way to manage their purchases and save items for later.
- **Sticky Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the page, making it easy for users to access key sections of the website.
- **Drawer-based Mobile Menu**: The website offers a responsive mobile menu, accessible through a drawer-based interface, ensuring a great user experience on smaller screens.

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **ReactJS**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React Router**: Enables client-side routing and navigation.
- **Material UI**: A comprehensive UI component library for React, providing a modern and visually appealing design.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the custom components.
- **Fake Store API**: A free and open-source API used to fetch product data for the website.
